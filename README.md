# Download Steam Game Library Covers Script
## What is it?
A python-powered script that will download game icon covers from your library, or just about from anyone else's game library.
## How does it work?

## Why create something that's unnecessary?
Because when you just wanted to get a game cover from a game of yours, but it isn't available in the `Steam/appcache/librarycache` folder, or you just want to gain the most library covers so you can *all* archive it into one big folder for everyone else to have!
## How do you use it?
Simply download the bat (or sh, if you're on Linux/OSX) and python files into a folder that you want to download the game covers into, then run the bat/sh file.
## Can I contribute to it?
Of course! Any work that would help in making this python-powered script better is always useful!
