# Download Steam Game Library Covers Script
## What is it?
A python-powered script that will download game icon covers from your library, or just about from anyone else's game library.
## How does it work?
It uses your Steam ID, or a link to your Steam profile, and then grabs a list of the games that you own that are in your library. With grabbing an AppID of each game of yours, it then downloads from a specific URL with that AppID to download game covers that are available by a game of yours.
## Why create something that's unnecessary?
Because when you just wanted to get a game cover from a game of yours, but it isn't available in the `Steam/appcache/librarycache` folder, or you just want to gain the most library covers so you can *all* archive it into one big folder for everyone else to have!
## How do you use it?
Simply download the bat (or sh, if you're on Linux/OSX) and python files into a folder that you want to download the game covers into, then run the bat/sh file.
## Can I contribute to it?
Of course! Any work that would help in making this python-powered script better is always useful!
## Credits
Thanks to Havatra on StackExchange for providing a base to the code which was provided in answer, from [here](https://gaming.stackexchange.com/a/359643/216848), and not minding their code being re-worked when PM'd about it.
## Better version of this program
With having a conversation and asking for help from a friend which originally was for asking help on coding, he ended up making this program a lot better, which can be found [here](https://github.com/depthbomb/AppImageDownloader)!
